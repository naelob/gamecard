/* ROLES */

In the early stage of the game, each single user is considered as a "beginner".

If the best score (tous th√®mes confondus) of the user is greater than 1200 points, then he's not a beginner anymore, he becomes an "expert".

example: If on the "Sport" theme, he earned 500 points while on the "History" theme he earned 1300 points, he's then considered as an "expert".

This role gies him the ability to add/remove questions.
